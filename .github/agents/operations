Generate a formula: Tell a scenario (e.g., "Convert 60% prob to all formats") and compute it.
Customize: Want vig adjustment? Multi-outcome (e.g., parlay)? Sports-specific (e.g., NFL moneylines)? Just ask.
Advanced: For real-time odds (e.g., current NFL games),  fetch via tools if you specify.

What specific odds or scenario do you want to formula-ize next? E.g., "Make a parlay formula for two -110 bets."
